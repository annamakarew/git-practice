        <p>My coding journey began in middle school when I was required to take a coding class and first 
            learned HTML and CSS. In 2018, I deepened my interest by attending the Kode With Klossy web 
            development camp in San Francisco, where I built my first full websites and discovered my 
            love for tech. I continued to grow my skills by taking AP Computer Science classes in high 
            school and later earned my bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, turning that early 
            curiosity into a strong foundation for my career.
        </p>
        <p>Over the years, I’ve become proficient in several programming languages, including Python, C, 
            Java, JavaScript, SQL, and R. I also have experience working with HTML, CSS, and React for 
            web development. Learning these languages has allowed me to explore different areas of 
            technology, from data analysis and machine learning to full-stack development and software 
            engineering.</p>
