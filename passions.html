        <p>I love line dancing! I grew up competitively tap dancing and was introduced to line dancing in college.
          As an adult, it is difficult to find opportunities to dance, and I found a new passion within line dancing!
          Currently my favorite dances are Stetson, Pieces to the Puzzle, Fuego, 3 Tequila Floor, and The Vibe.

        <p>Another concert! My mom took me to the Eras Tour in Toronto (night 6!). 
          My surprise songs on the guitar were Sparks Fly x Message in a Bottle, 
          and on the piano they were You're Losing Me x How Did it End?
        I was channeling Speak Now with my purple dress, and my mom embraced her Red era!</p>

          and she is a 3-year-old mini goldendoodle.
